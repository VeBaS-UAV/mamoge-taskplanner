# MamoGe Taskplanner

## Architecture Idea and Design

The Main Components are `TaskPlanner`, `ProcessBoard` and the `Worker`s. There is a basic implamentation for all of them which are supposed to be used as interfaces (abstract classes) that will be implemented to allow different communication philosophies.

Sequence Diagram Business Logic:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    WorkerAgent->>+WorkerAPI: register
    WorkerAPI->>+PlannerREST: route register()
    PlannerREST->>+PlannerREST: append worker to list
    PlannerREST->>+PlannerREST: planning(workers, resources)
    PlannerREST->>+WorkerAPI: push Task list
    WorkerAPI->>+WorkerAgent: route taskPush
```

Sequence Diagram Communication with a Flavor, e.g. a Message Queue Backend with persistance:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    WorkerAgent->>+WorkerAPI: register
    WorkerAPI->>+Backend (Store & Comm): send register message
    loop e.g. event processing
        activate Planner
        Planner-->Backend (Store & Comm): subscribed
        Planner->>Planner: append worker to list
        Planner->>Planner: planning(workers, resources)
        Planner->>Backend (Store & Comm): publish Task list
        deactivate Planner
    end
    loop e.g. event processing
        WorkerAPI-->Backend (Store & Comm): subscribed
    end
    WorkerAPI->>+WorkerAgent: route taskPush
```

Task State Diagram

``` mermaid

    direction LR
    [*] --> UNDEFINED
    UNDEFINED --> AVAILABLE: E_ACTIVATE
    AVAILABLE --> PENDING: E_RESERVE
    PENDING --> AVAILABLE: E_REJECTED
    PENDING --> SCHEDULED: E_ACCEPTED
    SCHEDULED --> RUNNING: E_START
    SCHEDULED --> AVAILABLE: E_REJECTED
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED: E_DONE
    RUNNING --> FAILURE: E_ERROR
    FAILURE --> AVAILABLE: E_RESET
    COMPLETED --> [*]

## Setup development environment
The `settings.json` file for `vscode` is included in the repository for a minimum of common configuration rules. When using `vscode` this means that there are specific local configuration options that have to be adopted, since the GitHub pipeline will fail otherwise.

When *not* using `vscode`, please make sure that your editor supports a *"format on save"-ish* option. Also `pre-commit` is *recommended* be utilized, see below.

**Developing with a [devcontainer ðŸ”—](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/developer-experience/devcontainers/).**  
When opening in vscode start the dev environment with `reopen in container`. Please also refer to the official documentation.

## Python linting and formatting

**Mandatory** packages:
- `black`

*Recommended* packages:
- `bandit`
- `flake8`
- `pycodestyle`
- `pydocstyle`

## git pre-commits

[See the official tutorial for a general introduction](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#intro) on `pre-commit`. We *recommend* to utilize `pre-commit` to ensure that all code that is pushed to the repository follows certain code quality rules. The alternative is to ensure that code is always formatted with black.

As of now, `pre-commit` is only prepared for Python code. The rules are set by `black`, [see the official documentation](https://github.com/psf/black) for more detail.

The `pre-commit` configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) has already been added to the project repository. Run the following line to use it:
```console
pre-commit install
```
> `pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit`

Now `pre-commit` will run automatically on `git commit`.

You can check if it is working and also initialize the first use by running the following command in the project root:
```console
pre-commit run --all-files
```
